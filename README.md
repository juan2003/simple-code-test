Frontend Code Test
==================

Write a frontend JavaScript application that displays a list of musicians
specified in `musicians.json`. Each musician should also show the band they
belong to. Your output should match:

* Corey Taylor - Slipknot
* Rodrigo Sanchez - Rodrigo y Gabriella
* Gabriella Quintero - Rodrigo y Gabriella
* Richard Baker - MGK

Style it however you wish. Use whatever libraries or frameworks you'd like.

Also, normalize all the snake_cased property names in your app so that they are
camelCased. For example, `first_name` becomes `firstName` and `last_name`
becomes `lastName`.

Submit your code by providing us with a link to a repo on Github or Bitbucket.
